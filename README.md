SafePass 

Our project, SafePass, is a password management system that we created using Spring Boot, MySQL, and Java. 

Before running the application there are a few requirements that must be met in order to execute this code:
  1. You mush have a MySQL Community Server running on your computer.
  2. Go to /src/main/resources and find a file named "application.properties". Change "password" to the password of your MySQL server password.

After completing the above requirements, run PasswordManagerApplication.java, which can be found in src/main/java.
